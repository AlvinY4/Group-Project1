# Guess That Movie Release Year
## Group 1 Project 1 

For this project, we created a website called "Guess That Movie Release Year." It is a game users can play to test their Hollywood knowledge. The objective is to match a movie poster with the correct release date. To launch the game, users have to click the red button, which will display a movie poster with its title and four release date choices. The user then clicks on the date they believe is correct. The game will save their data to the local storage and later present them with the number guessed correct and which movie genre the user is most knowledgeable. The user can play as many rounds as wanted. To achieve this, we used Tailwinds CSS and two API's, IMBD-API and the OMDB-API.
